## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Modern & Animated UI/UX:** A clean, responsive, and professional design built with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI, featuring smooth, scroll-based animations powered by **Framer Motion**.
- **Dynamic Developer Feed:** A "Tinder-style" card interface for browsing potential matches, with interactive buttons to express interest or ignore profiles.
- **Interactive Profile Management:** Intuitive forms for creating and updating a rich user profile with personal details and a list of technical skills.
- **Full Request Lifecycle:** Complete user flows for viewing, accepting, and rejecting connection requests, with real-time UI updates upon action.
- **Global State Management:** Uses **Redux Toolkit** for robust session management and for caching server state (user profile, feed, connections) across the application.
- **Protected Routing:** A client-side routing setup that includes a loading state to handle session persistence on refresh and automatically protects routes, redirecting unauthenticated users.
